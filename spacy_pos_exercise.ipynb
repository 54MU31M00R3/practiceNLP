That represented a slight ease from March’s peak but was still close to the highest level since the summer of 1982.\\n',\n",

Real wages adjusted for inflation decreased 0.1% on the month despite a nominal increase of 0.3% in average hourly earnings.

Rising prices at the pump and in grocery stores have been one problem, but inflation has spread beyond those two areas into housing, auto sales and a host of other areas.\\n',\n",
